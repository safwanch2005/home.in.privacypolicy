    <h2>Data Security</h2>
    <p>We take the security of your data seriously and use commercially acceptable means to protect your personal information. However, no method of transmission over the internet or method of electronic storage is 100% secure, and we cannot guarantee its absolute security.</p>

    <h3>Data Encryption</h3>
